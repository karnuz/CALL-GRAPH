Example:

Main instantiates C1 and C2
Main calls A,C1
A C1 instantiates C2
A C1 calls F C2
F C2 instantiates C8
F C2 instantiates C321
Field C8 x has declared type C3
F C2 writes in field C8 x
F C2 returns with type C8
A C1 reads C8,x
A C1 calls M,C321. staticLookup transfers it to M,C32
E has parameter type C7, C8 (C7  declared in A, C8 came as return type from F)
E calls A C7
E calls B C8

The above is also reflected in our output from algorithm.
